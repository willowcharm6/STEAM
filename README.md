# STEAM (See, Touch, Engage, Activate, Move) - Executive Summary
## Project Problem
In collaboration with the Wilmette Historical Museum, we identified a need for an engaging, accessible exhibit to teach visitors about steam engine mechanics. Existing displays often fail to captivate multi-generational audiences, relying on static models or text-heavy panels that overlook hands-on learning opportunities.

## Project Requirements
Our goal was to create an interactive exhibit that:
- Makes STEM concepts intuitive through tactile and auditory experiences
- Accommodates visitors of all ages and abilities
- Requires minimal maintenance by museum staff
- Stays within a $150 budget

## Research and Development
We interviewed museum director Rachel Ramirez and Keith Boyd about what they were both envisioning for the museum exhibit: hands-on STEM education with accessible wording. We researched user interactions with exhibits and tested 8 prototype concepts. Testing revealed that users were heavily drawn to the touch board stating that it was enjoyable to play with the objects while learning new concepts.

## Design Summary
Our final design, STEAM, is a stand-alone exhibit that combines:
The original model steam engine as the center-piece of the exhibit, displayed under a plexiglass case for its protection
- A model train engine to contextualize the steam engine’s usage
- A hands-on touchboard where users can manipulate textured coal, a piston mechanism, a water chamber, and a grooved flywheel to explore mechanics
- An interactive flip board that teaches visitors about the process of a steam engine with question and answer boards on hinges
- Audio enhancements with button-triggered audio to enhance accessibility by reading out the text and adding depth by including engine sounds
- A modular frame of a wooden base that can be easily assembled by museum staff or an external company that has access to blueprints
This design improves upon traditional exhibits by making invisible physics tangible. Future upgrades could integrate lights as well as an additional AR application viewable on user’s phones.
